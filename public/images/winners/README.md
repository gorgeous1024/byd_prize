# Winner Images

Place winner profile images in this directory.

## File Naming Convention
Use lowercase with hyphens for file names matching the winner's name:
- `sarah-johnson.jpg`
- `michael-chen.jpg`
- `emily-rodriguez.jpg`
- `david-kim.jpg`
- `lisa-martinez.jpg`
- `james-wilson.jpg`

## Image Requirements
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Recommended size**: 800x800px (square aspect ratio works best)
- **File size**: Keep under 500KB for optimal loading
- **Quality**: High quality portrait photos

## How to Add Images
1. Save your image files with the exact names listed above
2. Place them in this directory: `public/images/winners/`
3. The images will be automatically loaded by the Winners component

## Notes
- Images in the `public` folder are served as static assets
- Use relative paths starting with `/images/winners/` in the code
- Vite serves these files directly without processing
